🌟 Exciting Project Update: Automated AWS Infrastructure Deployment using Terraform! 🚀

I am thrilled to share a recent project where I set up a comprehensive infrastructure on AWS using Terraform. The project seamlessly integrates various AWS services to provide a reliable and scalable web application environment.

### Project Highlights:

#### 🔧 **VPC Creation:**
- Established a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with two subnets, designed to enhance network isolation and security.

#### 🌐 **Networking Components:**
- Configured an Internet Gateway for internet access.
- Created and associated a Route Table to ensure smooth traffic flow.

#### 🔒 **Security Groups:**
- Implemented security groups to manage incoming and outgoing traffic. Specifically, allowed HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic for web server access and management.

#### 🖥️ **EC2 Instances:**
- Deployed two EC2 instances across different subnets for high availability.
- Configured instances using user data scripts to run Apache web servers, serving a portfolio webpage.

#### ⚖️ **Load Balancing:**
- Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming web traffic evenly across EC2 instances, enhancing fault tolerance and performance.

#### 💾 **S3 Bucket:**
- Created an S3 bucket for storing and serving static content such as images, utilized by the web servers.

### Tools & Technologies:

- **Terraform**: Defined and provisioned the complete infrastructure as code.
- **AWS Services**: 
  - **VPC**
  - **EC2**
  - **S3**
  - **ALB**
- **Apache**: Deployed as the web server on EC2 instances.
- **AWS CLI**: Integrated into user data scripts for efficient interaction with AWS services.

### Key Functionalities:

1. **Network Configuration**:
   - High-availability VPC setup with subnets in distinct availability zones.
   - Internet Gateway and Route Table setup for seamless internet connectivity.

2. **Instance Security**:
   - Applied strict security group rules for secure access and operations.
   - Configured to allow necessary HTTP and SSH traffic.

3. **Web Server Setup**:
   - Automated Apache web server installation and configuration via user data scripts.
   - Downloaded and served images from the S3 bucket.

4. **Load Balancing**:
   - Ensured web traffic distribution with an ALB, providing improved load handling and redundancy.

The Terraform scripts meticulously handle the detailed setup for each resource, ensuring a robust, secure, and scalable architecture.

I am immensely proud of this project, demonstrating the power of modern DevOps tools and cloud services in creating efficient and scalable solutions. Looking forward to leveraging this knowledge in future endeavors. 💡✨
